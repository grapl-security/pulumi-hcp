# Convenient check to ensure that we've committed all the generated
# SDK files to the repository.
#
# Normally, I'm not very fond of committing generated code, but
# because Go uses git as its package manager, we **have** to commit
# the Go SDK code. At that point, there's not much difference in
# committing the code for the other SDKs.
#
# (We also have to commit the schema.json file for the Pulumi Registry
# to work properly, and it's generated, too.)
#
# Here, we just build the SDKs and then check to see that we didn't
# generate anything different from what's already in version
# control. If we did, then that either means that somebody forgot to
# commit something, or there's some kind of odd tooling difference
# between the engineer's workstation and CI.
